          <h1 class="intro-blog">Our Mission</h1>
          <p class="blog1">This website should be a place for original ideas of high school students. There are going to be many originals here that spark inspirational ideas. People are going to be communicating with their originals and sharing ideas. This is not like any other art paint website or stock photos website, because although they also show art paints and stock photos for people to download, people don't communicate about their ideas there, but we want ideas to collide with each other, and if people want to start a shop elsewhere, they need to pay money, whereas on my website, it is free.Â  The idea behind my website is "sharing and earning"; people share their originals and earn virtual money from others. People can reward each other by Y dollars if they love each other's idea.</p>
        </div> -->
        <!-- <div class="stock-photos">
          <h1 class="intro-photos">What can I do on this webiste?</h1>
          <p class="photos1">
            First of all, this website is not asking for professional work; it is not intimedating as you think. We are just sharing original ideas here. You can do anything. Here are some examples: you can shot a beautiful photo, you can share your own sheet music composed by you, you can draw an art piece, you can also provide ideas of a product by writing those ideas down and draw some pictures to help visualizing it, you can also give strategies for studying, you can design a clothes, or design a shoes, you can also give your own opinions on current news, they can be about social issues, or economics or politics. There are so many things you can do here on this website, you can think of much more things to do, don't limit yourself to the ideas that I suggested above.
