        This video is about the trade creation. One important message: before the trade creation, France was producing Q3 amount of the goods, which includes the 
        amount Q3-Q1.
        After the trade creation, France is producing Q1 amount of the goods. Q2-Q1 amount of the goods are imported from UK, and this amount obviously includes
        Q3-Q1, and that's why I said Q3-Q1 amount of goods was produced by high cost producer France to a low cost producer UK. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Remember, it is not a country that has changed itself from a high cost producer to a low cost producer, it is the goods changed themselves from 
        producing by a high cost producer to a low cost producer.
