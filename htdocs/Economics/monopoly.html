          This video is about firms earning abnormal profits in the short run and earning normal profits in the 
          long run. I think you should read the textbook first before watching this video, because you should know
          what AR, MR, AC, MC are. And in the end, hope you enjoy this video. I was being a little bit fast.

            read the textbook first. Have some knowledge about the perfect competition. This video is only about the graph.

          This video is about the monopolistic competition. I included the firms making abnormal profits and making
          losses together in one video, and I also included that they will both lead to normal profits in the long run. 
          This video is content heavy, but you can pause and ponder if you feel it is going fast.
