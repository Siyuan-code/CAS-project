Hello and Welcome to this website:

If you are on this page that means you are my partner in creating this website, and I am very gald to have you as a partner,

This is a rigourous task, and it is also a very difficult project, by the way, it is Ambitious.

first of all,
You need to know HTML and CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL; those are the basics in creating this website, and we must know these very well, although even for me I don't find myself knowing them extremely well, I decided to watch videos about them in order to learn them. That is what I did in the first week and also throughout the winter break. The most difficult among them should be JavaScript because it is a little bit complicated compare to others.

I should say HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the project, you must know them first, or else there is nothing you can do. By the way, every time I do it, I feel the excitement.

Now, there has been 85 days since the first day that I started this project. The time passed fast also I have done the homepage of the website which is first draft of the hoempage and temporarily I'm satisfied with it, of course, later, I will make changes to improve it. The homepage is done during the winter break.

Honestly, 85 days ago, I won't have thought that I'm able to do it, because I do not know anything about HTML and CSS, and those other languages. However, after I learned from Youtube, I made such website which is not very impressive, but in my point of view, this is very impressive.

Building this website is really hurting my eyes, I feel desperately that my eyes need some rest. I hope, really hope that my partner could do something there, because for now, I'm the only person who has really spent time on creating that website. If my partner also participate in it, the whole process would be much faster.

Now, there is even a loginsystem in my website, I'm very proud of it, of course, I learned that from Youtube too. Youtube is a great place for learning. There are a lot wonderful people there who made incredible videos that are really helpful.

The only problem is that the whole project takes a lot of time, even you just want to do a little thing.

By the way, I have not worked on the website for a month, now, after the homeapge and the login system, I'm currently working on one of the subpages, however, I don't know how to design it. I think the hardest part is not coding but designing. I should spend some time to think about it.
